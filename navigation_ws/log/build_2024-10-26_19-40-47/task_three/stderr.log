[33mCMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable PCL_ROOT is set to:

    /usr

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target task_three_node
  because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libz.so.1] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/chen/miniconda3/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
